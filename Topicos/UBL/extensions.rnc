# Modify this module to engage the extensions for the UBL extension point.

# List here all of the namespaces used for apex element names below
namespace sig =
  "urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:CommonSignatureComponents-2"

# Include here all the extension schemas
include "versions/UBL-CommonSignatureComponents-2.1.rnc"

# Pull in the apex pattern of all extension schemas as a single element choice
ExtensionContentDataType = 
    (
      CommonSignatureComponents_UBLDocumentSignatures
     | 
      any-other-apex-element  # allowing any other element as unknown extension
    )

# Validated apex element names must be excluded or the wildcard will allow them
any-other-apex-element = element * - sig:UBLDocumentSignatures
        { 
          attribute * { text }*,
          ( any | text )*
        }

# Anything is allowed below an apex element
# Important note:
#   This wildcard pattern for attributes conflicts with any attribute of type
#   xsd:ID.  Unfortunately, the wildcard cannot exclude known attributes of
#   type xsd:ID because other unknown extensions may have similarly-named
#   attributes.  This results in being unable to validate the ID-ness of
#   extension attributes of type xsd:ID.  To avoid the conflict, the easiest
#   thing to do is change the attributes of type xsd:ID to be xsd:NMTOKEN.
#   If this is not possible, then run validation without ID/IDREF checking.
#   While modifying the pattern below to explicitly exclude named attributes
#   of type xsd:ID would seem the right thing to do, the constraint of an
#   attribute of type ID not allowed to be a descendant of a wildcard element
#   is at: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/compatibility.html#id
#   where it reads: "the first child of the element ancestor is a name element"
any = element *
        { 
          attribute * { text }*,
          ( any | text )*
        }
